                <h1 class="page-title" id="sunscreen"> Sunscreen</h1>
                <p>
                    Every skin care expert agrees on one thing, that sunscreen is the most crutial skin-care
                    product. Daily and consistent sunscreen use helps to prevent the development of 
                    fine lines and wrinkles, textual imperfections, and changes in the appearance of pores 
                    overtime. But the most important thing is that is can prevent the formation of skin cancer.
                    So make sure to use sunscreen daily with SPF of at least 30.
                </p>
                <h2 class="page-subt">How often should I apply sunscreen ?</h2>
                <p>
                    Whether you are spending the aftenoon in the sun or not, make sure you are applying enought sunscreen
                    for it to actually be effective. An average person in a bathing suit needs a full ounce to cover all 
                    exposed areas, including your face, every 2 hours. <br>
                    If your are at the beach for 6 hours in the sun you will need at least a 3-ounce bottle of sunscreen. <br>
                    Even if you're not spending the afternoon at the pool, you're still guarenteed to come into contact with 
                    UV rays through the window or ny peeking outside. Studies show that daily use of sunscreen can significantly
                    lower your risk of skin cancer and signs of skin aging, such as wrinkles, hyperpigmentation, and dark spots. <br>
                    <strong>Reapplication reminders: </strong> Always reapply sunscreen. Aim for every 2 hours if you're
                    outside. What you initially put on can move or shift throuhtout the day. It also takes about 20 minutes for sunscreen 
                    to work. If your sunscreen has thicker zink oxide, you may be able to get away with less sunscreen, but of you're unsure,
                    don't risk it!
                </p>
                <h1 class="page-title" id="cleansing"> Cleansing</h1>
                <p>
                    Washing your face is the most basic and essential step of any routine. Wash twice a day, morning and night, to avid 
                    clogged pores, dullness and acne. <br>
                    Another really important thing you should keep in mind is finding your facial cleanser. The right formula cleanses your 
                    skin without stripping essential, healthy oils. Take it easy with exfoliating scrubs (use only once a week) and avoid those 
                    with crushed walnut shells or abrasive ingredients.
                    <br>
                    For everyday cleansing, here's what to look for:

                <h1 class="page-title" id="toning">Toning</h1>
                <p>
                    Think of toners as supplements - these thin liquids deliver an extra shot of nutrients, helping the other products in your regimen absorb better, while
                    still balancing your complexion. However, most experts consider toner to be optional, it can be a good way to add in specific ingredients that you may not have 
                    in your other products or add another layer of skin-replenishment. If you have the time and inclination here are some indredients to look for:
                    <ul>
                        <li> <strong>Alpha and beta hydroxy</strong> acids to gently remove dead skin cells that can clog pores, improve sun damages skin and minimize dullnes.</li>
                        <li> <strong>Hyaluronic acid</strong> to boost hydration, seal in dewiness and plump skin to subtly treat fine lines.</li>
                        <li> <strong>Rose water and green tea</strong> to calm irritation and reduce redness with an anti-inflammatory effect.</li>
                        <li> <strong>Vitamin E and C</strong> to fight daily exposure to free radicals that can age your skin</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    Tones should be done after cleansing and before putting on anything else. The traditional application method is to saturate a cotton pad and pass it over your face. But some 
                    argue that applying toner with clean hands is the most efficient. Just pour a few drops in your palm, then swipe it on. Most formulas can be used morning and night, but you might 
                    want to use those with exfoliating acids only at night or every other day.
                </p>
                <h1 class="page-title" id="serums">Serums</h1>
                <p>
                    Serums are powerful skill allies. Filled with concentrated doses of active ingredients, these elixirs can mitigate a number of issued, from dark spots to wrinkles. Even if you don't have any 
                    specific issues, everyone still needs a general antioxidant serum in the morning to protect form daily agressors. While there are limitless opitions, to handle specific issues, look for there products:
                    <ul>
                        <li> <strong>Hyaluronic acid</strong> to seal in hydration and strengthen the barrier function to prevent moisture loss.</li>
                        <li> <strong>Vitamin C</strong> to help brighten dull skin and decrease dark spots with continued use.</li>
                        <li> <strong>Retinol, vitamin B3, peptides</strong> to stimulate the production of collagen and elastin, proteins in the body that helps prevent lines and skin sagging.</li>
                        <li> <strong>Colloidal sulfur, nicinamide</strong> to calm redness and irritation by decreasing inflammation, and improve acne with its antimicrobial effects.</li>
                    </ul>
                    If you have multiple concerns, you might want to use mulitple formulas. You should treat different areas with different products, maybe you will use a vitamin C serum all over but then dab on another for 
                    hyperpigmentation on just a few spots. Just run any combination by your dermatologist to avoid any potential reactions. <br> <br>
                    To save time, don't try mixing a serum into your moisturizer. This lessens the ability of the serum to absorb effectively. Products should be applied one by ome. <br> <br>
                    Not all serums are applied with the same frequency. This varies with the ingredients. For example antioxidants are better used in the morning because they give you additional protection from the enviroment,
                    and most of us don't use enough sunscreen as it is. Retinols are not sun-stable so they are best used at night. So make sure to read the label intructions carefully.
                </p>
                <h1 class="page-title" id="moisturizing">Moisturizing</h1>
                <p>
                    The most basic function of a moisturizer is to hydrate and soften the skin. Moisturizers assist in preventing water loss through the outer layers of skin, they can also complement the naturally found protective
                    oils and other building blocks within the skin, such as ceramides. This is one product that doctors recommend using year-round, for all skin types. Skin naturally loses the ability to retain moisture as we age, and daily
                    activities, such as washing, can strip natural hydrators from surface. <br>

                <p>
                    Creams you apply in the morning are equipped to protect your skin from the environmental aggressors you'll face when you leave the house many contain antioxidants
                    to minimize pollution-based free radicals and sunscreen to shield you from ultraviolet radiation. They typically have a lightweight consistency. Night creams, on the other hand, 
                    focus on repairing any damage you might have picked up with ingredients like retinol to speed cellular turnover and counteract dark spots. These creams also replenish moisture levels,
                    which naturally dip in the evening, with emollients that often create a rich, thick texture.

                    If you've exhausted your stash of hyaluronic acid serums and your dry skin still isn't getting the memo, then Escapada Health Co-Founder, Emilia Herting's DIY face mask recipe is the one for you. <br>
                    <h3>What you need: </h3>

                    </ul>

                    'The best way to balance dry skin is with the right foods and moisture,' explains Herting. 'This refreshing spring mask will hydrate your skin from within. For calming effects simply add a few drops of 
                    lavender essential oil to the mix. Lavender is probably the best known essential oil; its distinctive scent can help relax the nervous system and it is particularly useful for relieving symptoms of restlessness, irritability and insomnia.'
