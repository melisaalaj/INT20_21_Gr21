                <p>
                    The first thing to know when taking care of your skin is the <a href="https://askthescientists.com/skin-type-quiz/" target="_blank">type</a> of your skin.
                    Only when you know the type of your skin, you will be able to properly take care of it.
                </p>
                <h4 style="font-style: italic;"> Main steps: </h4>
                Your skin care contains of these main steps:
                <ol>
                    <li>Sunscreen - Protecting your skin from the UV rays</li>
                    <li>Cleansing - Washing your face</li>
                    <li>Toning - Balancing your skin</li>
                    <li>Moisturizing - Hydrating and softening your skin</li>
                </ol>

                <h1 class="page-title" id="sunscreen"> Sunscreen</h1>
                <p>
                    Every skin care expert agrees on one thing, that sunscreen is the most crutial skin-care
                    product. Daily and consistent sunscreen use helps to prevent the development of 
                    fine lines and wrinkles, textual imperfections, and changes in the appearance of pores 
                    overtime. But the most important thing is that is can prevent the formation of skin cancer.
                    So make sure to use sunscreen daily with SPF of at least 30.
                </p>
                <h2 class="page-subt">How often should I apply sunscreen ?</h2>
                <p>
                    Whether you are spending the aftenoon in the sun or not, make sure you are applying enought sunscreen
                    for it to actually be effective. An average person in a bathing suit needs a full ounce to cover all 
                    exposed areas, including your face, every 2 hours. <br>
                    If your are at the beach for 6 hours in the sun you will need at least a 3-ounce bottle of sunscreen. <br>
                    Even if you're not spending the afternoon at the pool, you're still guarenteed to come into contact with 
                    UV rays through the window or ny peeking outside. Studies show that daily use of sunscreen can significantly
                    lower your risk of skin cancer and signs of skin aging, such as wrinkles, hyperpigmentation, and dark spots. <br>
                    <strong>Reapplication reminders: </strong> Always reapply sunscreen. Aim for every 2 hours if you're
                    outside. What you initially put on can move or shift throuhtout the day. It also takes about 20 minutes for sunscreen 
                    to work. If your sunscreen has thicker zink oxide, you may be able to get away with less sunscreen, but of you're unsure,
                    don't risk it!
                </p>
                <h1 class="page-title" id="cleansing"> Cleansing</h1>
                <p>
                    Washing your face is the most basic and essential step of any routine. Wash twice a day, morning and night, to avid 
                    clogged pores, dullness and acne. <br>
                    Another really important thing you should keep in mind is finding your facial cleanser. The right formula cleanses your 
                    skin without stripping essential, healthy oils. Take it easy with exfoliating scrubs (use only once a week) and avoid those 
                    with crushed walnut shells or abrasive ingredients.
                    <br>
                    For everyday cleansing, here's what to look for:

                        <td>When it activated with water or pumped into your palm, this cleanser morphs into an airy foam that helps break down
                            dirt and excess sebum from pores.

                        </td>

                        <td>A staple of French routines, this soap-free option contains molecules that attract debris and oil like a magnet without causing any dryness.
                            It's suitable for almost every skin type and unlike most other cleansers, there's no need to rinse it or rub it in - a simple swipe will do.
